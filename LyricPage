  <p> I bruise easily</br>
So don't push me around</br>
      If you want me to look pretty</br>

I got cold feet</br>
Racing bare-foot</br>
Through the possibilities in my head</br></p>
<p>
I stopped listening</br>
Now I'm spiraling</br>
Seducing bad thoughts as they pass</br>

And there's a reason why</br>
I can't get the words off my tongue</br>
How long before I choke</br>
On masturbatory apologies meant for you</br></p>
<p>
I felt ugly</br>
I wouldn't know validation</br>
If she were lying in my bed</br>

I poured gasoline</br>
On a spark you were having</br>
That I mistook for the sun</br>
When I was dumb enough to look</br></p>
<p>
You stopped listening</br>
now you're spiraling</br>
Suppressing bad thoughts with your laugh</br>

And there's a reason why</br>
I can't get the words off my tongue</br>
How long before I choke</br>
On every word</br>
      Meant for you</p>

             Sad day serum </br>
One more taste and i'll be free</br>
Do you want to come with me?</br>
Where the cynicism sleeps</br>
I’ve got you in submission now</br>
Your pigtail innocence let down</br>
Every silver lining was a mirage</br>
Your love letter was a picture on the web</br>
</p>
<p>
Four in the morning is as good</br>
As any other fucking time</br>
If you’d like to call it quits</br>
If you’d like to change my mind</br>
</p>
<p>
Well now that it is</br>
Four in the morning,</br>
Its as good</br>
As any other fucking time,</br>
If you’d like to spill your guts</br>
Or if you wanna step on mine</br>
</p>
<p>
I feel delirious</br>
And don’t know why</br>

</p>
<p>
Bad day victim</br>
Please don't take it so personally</br>
I’ll take you with me</br>
Where the chemicals are cheap</br>
I can start to see it clearly now</br>
Every silver lining was really gold</br>
Your love letter</br>
Was a phone number</br>
Written on the bathroom wall</br>
</p>
<p>
Four in the morning is as good</br>
As any other fucking time</br>
If you would like to call it quits</br>
If you’d like to change my mind</br>

      I'm feeling desperate again</br>
Shed off all of my skin</br>
For a night in your t-shirt</br>
Gave me your favorite pen</br>
Just to write me off</br>
And be sure to make it personal</br>
I'm stuck in nervousness now</br>
Won't be sticking around</br>
To see where it leads to</br>
I'm getting sick of the lies</br>
Can you make up your mind?</br>
</p>
<p>
All the booze and the clubs</br>
Has its ups and it's downs</br>
But lately just lonely</br>
I've been trapped in your roos</br>
Tryna sound the alarm</br>
There's no exit to run to</br>
I'm under chemical spells</br>
That you kept in your purse</br>
To speed up my impulse</br>
I'm getting sick of the lies</br>
Won't you make up your mind?</br>

           <p>I catch your signals in my head</br>
Bounce them back and forth</br>
Off your eyes and back to my old lies</br>
Let me go</br>
</p>
<p>
Every beat to your heart</br>
Is a tic towards death</br>
I've lost the feeling</br>
Faster than I thought I would have</br>
</p>
<p>
I feel love;
I feel love;
I feel love;</br>
I feel disconnection twice as much</br>
</p>
<p>
Small talk and gestures to your room</br>
I feel like we've lost the tune</br>
The parties gone</br>
And the lights are off</br>
</p>
<p>
Every breath under your nose</br>
Is a soft reminder</br>
That the feeling is flooding in</br>
And slipping through my hands</br>
</p>
<p>
I feel love</br>
I feel love</br>
</p>
<p>
I catch your sickness in my arms</br>
Hit the floor again; back to my feet</br>
My stomachs sinks</br>
I cave in</br>
I lost the feeling faster than</br>
You thought I would have</br>
</p>
<p>
I've become another thing</br>
For you to waste time on</br>
A line in your address book you've put to bed</br>
There's a wall for every season we spent</br>
Lying down when the sun is up</br>

Fever dreams they come in threes</br>
Like bad reminders</br>
That the ceiling is crumbling</br>
The rain drowns out my plans</br>
</p>
<p>
I feel love;
I feel love</br>
Feel disconnection twice as much</br>

             Because the shadow around your eyes</br>
Can keep me in the dark for days</br>
You stain my lips your favorite shade</br>
Bleeds on your cups and on your smokes</br>

Our day dream void has been filled with</br>
Sentiments, and politics,</br>
And anything we can come up with</br>
And solitary became</br>
The metropolitan version of</br>
Isolation wrapped around my skin</br>
</p>
<p>
In fruition where I fixate like an open invitation</br>
Save the pixels in my head</br>
Just like a photograph</br>
</p>
<p>
Because the bags around my eyes</br>
Can keep this talk for twenty four</br>
You work the days, and I work nights</br>
So I'm like a zombie in your world</br>

Your day dream boy has been tricking you</br>
With compliments, and confidence,</br>
And anything he can get away with</br>
'Cause in this dream I had</br>
You're wrapped around his finger like a spell</br>
And I can't break it</br>
With the existential reasons that I have</br>
</p>
<p>
In a familiarly melancholy frequency</br>
Somehow a wave length finds you near</br>
</p>
<p>
It all crumbles down</br>
Like the dust of my favorite designer drug,</br>
And I'm holding out my tongue</br>
To catch the rest of what I can</br>
Before the dopamine runs out</br>
You send me back to crave it bad</br>

Can't put numbers to the words</br>
Or words to how it felt</br>
When it was simplified</br>
I quantified the cataclysmic fall</br>
From here to there is like</br>
The distance I've been closing off for years</br>
And now I'm somewhere in the middle</br>
Still surprised you met me here</br>
</p>
<p>
I'm still surprised you've met me here</br>

On my pointless, pissed off, woe is me rapport</br>

I’ve been settling</br>
In this one bedroom disease</br>
Social life murder suicide</br>
Crashed a party in the coulda-beens</br>
shoulda spent the last year</br>
meaning one fucking word I said</br>
</p>
<p>
That’s what I get</br>
That’s what you get</br>
</p>
<p>
In the mouse trap</br>
With my eyes closed</br>
I know you put me here</br>
But I felt for it</br>
My hysteria dissolves</br>
In the sweet spot on your tongue</br>
Like how we shared everything</br>
to split the guilt, to pass the weeks</br>

             he's a class act piece of shit</br>
with a sense of humor that its</br>
just enough to get him by</br> the crisis of his yesterday</br>
He’s paying rent with change</br>
tomorrow he'll have to find another way</br>
so he goes home and tells himself a joke
like</br>
this is just the alibi</br> the story's what i'm waiting on</br>
im the good guy,</br> the plot has always got me wrong</br>
his fantasy is drowning out all the lies</br>
for a minute he feels fine</br>
</p>
<p>
He's a say-but-never-do</br>Preach-it kind of hypocrite</br>
He looks you in the eyes</br> With his fingers crossed behind his tongue</br>
His lips pursed like a model,</br> Under the influence
of anything</br> That gets him by another night,</br>
Another fight by himself</br> In the corner of his mind</br>
Beats himself to death</br> With the words of his past</br>
And his present aint pretty</br> He'll dress it up with lipstick and blush</br>
'Cause the futures always looking up</br>
</p>
<p>
And he's a feel-bad-for-himself</br>- Stupid fucking narcissist</br>
Who thinks he's too good</br> For any of your politics</br>
Except when his own opinions being challenged by</br>
Any bystander or anybody else's god</br>
He'll miss mass for a headache,</br> Hungover all day
into the night</br> When he starts it all over again</br>
And feels the same shot</br> Coating over his heart</br>
'Cause for a minute he'll feel nothing at all</br>
</p>
<p>
I found a friend that knows me well</br>
Who’s with me everywhere i go</br>
And he sees everything i see</br>
He's talking crazy just like me</br>
It's such a simple way to be</br>
When i'm all by myself</br>

             The walls always listen, but the people come and go</br>
The nape of your neck surrenders to the passion storm</br>
Gave way under the spotlight of</br>
Receding details written in</br>
Small print form inside the gaze that you gave me when</br>
You’d check in, instead of always checking out</br>
Well, you never seem to notice now</br>
</p.
</br>
<p>
I’ll wait for you </br>
</p>
<p>
I was burning bridges in the candle next to my bed</br>
In my lack of excuse scent</br>
Repeating lines that youd feed me</br>
So I’d pretend just like your last boyfriend</br>
A better me’s approaching;</br> he’s tapping on my shoulder now</br>
Well, I never used to have to look</br>
</p>
<p>
I’ll wait for you </br>
</p>
<p>
This is just the pattern</br>
Though It never really matters</br>
‘Til the cats out of the bag</br>
And now I’m bending over backwards</br>
Just to have what we had</br> as if
I was happy then</br>
as if the reason why I’m trying</br> is the friction not the sickness in</br> my head
Is off my shoulders,</br> spinning 400 an hour,</br>
Call you coming off the downers</br>
So my problems just devour you</br>

The power cord for reasoning is shorting out,</br> I’m short of breath,</br> and I blame you</br>
But maybe it is me</br> and I should stop pointing the finger,</br> keep my lips closed</br>
</p>
<p>
The vessel walls will atrophy,</br> while I’m fast asleep;</br> some sick disease will take you</br>
Or maybe I’ll be wide awake,</br> not states away</br> salvaging some day dream</br>
The shelf life for happiness is short and</br>
Ive been bored to death,</br> i don’t blame you</br>

I'm running on fumes</br>
But you breathe them in,</br>
And transcend the limits</br>
I am foolishly amused</br>
In the worst ways babe</br>
I'm a vicious circle made for you</br>
Detox on the floor</br>
Keep the lock on the door</br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah</br>
Your words are hitting hard again</br>
Racing through my thoughts until there's</br>
</p>
<p>
Nothing left to do</br>
Lazy afternoons</br>
Queasy energy</br>
From here to the moon</br>
Wasnt good enough for you</br>
And the space we've put between</br>
The world keeps changing colors</br>
Every letter is upside down</br>
</p>
<p>
I crawl inside my skin</br>
Make a nest and sink right in</br>
Effortless apologies</br>
Pour out of me before I ever speak</br>
Sleepy eyes</br>
Thoughts of you</br>
Once a day nothing new</br>
How are you?</br>
Good I guess</br>
Still chasing life on a nine to five</br>
</p>
<p>
Give my charm a break</br>
I've gotta fake to make it</br>
Until I'm face to face with</br>
The desperate things I push away</br>
I'm a basket case</br>
Thirty six hours staying awake</br>
Coffee stains on the page</br>
Where I write about sleep</br>
Bad dreams, bad luck,</br>
Broken mirrors at my feet</br>
I'd kill for comatose</br>
I'll let my eye lids close when my ego has</br>
</p>
<p>
Nothing left to prove</br>
Crazy as it seems</br>
A hundred things to change</br>
Same sad ways to stay</br> 
the same apologist</br>
Pity party novelist</br>
The walls keep changing patterns</br>
The ceilings are upside down</br>
</p>
<p>
I crawl inside my skin</br>
Make a nest and sink right in</br>
Effortless apologies</br>
Pour out of me before I ever speak</br>
Sleepy eyes</br>
Thoughts of you</br>
Once a day nothing new</br>
How are you?</br>
Good I guess</br>
Still chasing life on a nine to five</br>
